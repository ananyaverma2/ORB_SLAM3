1. first download all the dependencies
	- eigen (through sudo, lib something)
	- pangolin (from source and build it using cmake)
	- realsense (from source and build it)
	- boost library also (some errors occured during building ORB-SLAM3)

2. download the EUROC dataset
	- downloaded the MH01 easy dataset (i have chnaged the path to make a folder for MH01: for euroc_examples.sh)	

3. download euroc_examples.sh
	- from another git forked repo
	- put in the root

4. run example for euroc dataset
	- run ./euroc_examples.sh
	- edit it to run for the MH01 only otherwise the results are not displayed
	- a window will appear showing the map as it gets created
	- find the output screenshot stored as orbslam3_euroc_output.png
	
5. move the folders for the dependencies outside
